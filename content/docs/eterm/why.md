We're heavy Claude Code users. We wanted a smoother, more immersive experience.

We looked around. Nothing quite fit what we had in mind. So we built one ourselves — with Claude.

If you share similar pain points, ETerm might help.

## MCP

From the start, we thought MCP was cool. A terminal should have one.

After we built it — wow, it can do task orchestration. Claude opening multiple windows, working in parallel, while you watch and step in anytime. Didn't expect that. Been using it daily ever since.

## Plugins

We think a terminal should be clean at its core.

But we also keep wanting to add things — a sidebar, a custom view, little tools here and there. So we built a plugin system. Plugins can define any view they want, not just a few fixed types.

We're trying to open up as much as we can. If there's something you need that we haven't exposed yet, let us know.

## Built for AI CLI

We built a few tools for our AI CLI workflow — [Memex](/docs/memex) for session history, [Vlaude](/docs/vlaude) for remote sessions, [MCP Router](/docs/mcp-router) for smarter tool loading.

They work on their own. But we found that when integrated with ETerm, the experience is much better — real-time sync, no services to manage, everything just works.

So we built plugins to bring them together.

We also added tab status indicators. When a session is thinking, waiting, or done, the tab shows it. Useful when you're running multiple sessions — you won't forget which ones have finished.
