<div class="my-8 pl-4 border-l-4 border-orange-500">

Father, I have sinned. I have sinned greatly.

I had twenty-three terminal windows open at once. Twenty-three. I counted.

I named them "aaa", "asdf", "test", "test2", "really-the-last-one", "this-time-for-real", "i-swear-this-is-final".

I don't remember what the fourteenth one was doing. I was afraid to close it. What if it was doing something important?

I stared at a blinking cursor for fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes. I started to wonder if it was mocking me.

I had four Claudes working at the same time. Then I became the fifth Claude. A human scheduler. My brain started to smoke.

I switched windows until my fingers cramped. Cmd+Tab, Cmd+Tab, Cmd+Tab, Cmd+Tab.

At 3 AM, I screamed at the screen: "WHICH ONE IS DONE?!"

My roommate called the police.

I thought this was the programmer's fate. I thought everyone lived like this.

**Father, was I wrong?**

</div>

<div class="my-8 pr-4 border-r-4 border-gray-500 text-right text-gray-400 italic">

Child. You were not wrong.

You simply didn't know.

</div>

<div class="my-8 pl-4 border-l-4 border-orange-500">

Didn't know what?

</div>

<div class="my-8 pr-4 border-r-4 border-gray-500 text-right text-gray-400 italic">

ETerm.

</div>

<div class="my-8 pl-4 border-l-4 border-orange-500">

...What's that? Can you eat it?

</div>

<div class="my-8 pr-4 border-r-4 border-gray-500 text-right text-gray-400 italic">

Better than eating.

Tabs glow. Green means done, yellow means waiting — you know who's who at a glance.

No guessing. No screaming. Your roommate doesn't call the police.

One command, and Claude opens its own windows, works in parallel, comes back to you when it's done.

You can go drink coffee. You can go sleep. You can live like a normal person.

</div>

<div class="my-8 pl-4 border-l-4 border-orange-500">

Father... I... all those nights...

</div>

<div class="my-8 pr-4 border-r-4 border-gray-500 text-right text-gray-400 italic">

Don't look back, child.

Those 3 AM screams, those Cmd+Tab cramps, those "finalfinal" windows...

**They're in the past now.**

</div>

<div class="my-8 pl-4 border-l-4 border-orange-500">

What... what should I do?

</div>

<div class="my-8 pr-4 border-r-4 border-gray-500 text-right text-gray-400 italic">

[The door is right there.](/docs/eterm/installation)

**Push it open.**

**And don't come back to confess the same sins.**
